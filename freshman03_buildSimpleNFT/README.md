# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

1. Compile the project: 
    $ npx hardhat compile
2. Deploy npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby

3. Go to Rinkeby Etherscan and search for the address that was printed.
If the address opens up on etherscan, you have deployed your first NFT ðŸŽ‰
4. Go to the transaction details by clicking on the transaction hash, check that there was a token transfered to your address
